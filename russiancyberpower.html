        <p>In 2022, Russia was ranked as the third overall most comprehensive global Cyber Power (Voo et al., 2022, p. 9), whose main cyber strengths lay in information control and offensive objectives (ibid., p. 24). It is important, therefore, to establish an understanding of what makes 'cyber power' in order to better assess the most important factors Russia needs at its disposal to exert such power. For the purposes of this essay, we shall adopt Voo et al.'s (2022, p. 7) definition – that 'cyber power' is "the effective deployment of cyber capabilities by a state to achieve its national objectives." Within this, stress must be placed on 'effective deployment' because it highlights the necessary cohesion between cyber strategy, resources, capabilities and objectives. Concerning Russia, therefore, we are examining the efficacy of the country's cyber agenda to maintain its position as a global Cyber Power.
Three key factors have been identified as fundamental for Russia to have at its disposal to be a Cyber Power, including: (1) domestic narrative control; (2) having a breadth of cyber strategies to employ; and (3) a 'whole-of-nation' (Klimburg, 2011, p. 173) awareness as to where the threshold of armed conflict lies with regards to cyber warfare. These are the most important because they form the foundation upon which Russian cyber power can be constructed and exerted, concerning both offensive cyber operations and Russia's national 'information operations' (Wilde, 2020) conceptualisation.     
Domestic narrative control is to be understood as the framing of the international world order by Russian authorities as a methodology to coerce and convince private cyber networks and individuals into alignment with Russia's cyber conceptualisation and assimilate them into its operations. The Russian breadth of cyber strategies involves direct offensive cyber warfare, indirect offensive operations, cyber espionage, psychological cyber warfare, information warfare, and cyber diplomacy – all both within the physical and virtual dimensions of cyber power (Nye Jr., 2011, p. 5). Thirdly, the 'whole-of-nation' awareness as to where the threshold of armed conflict lies with regard to cyber warfare means that all individuals involved in Russian cyber operations, particularly offensive, understand where the limit is of cyber attacks before a physical armed retaliation is required by the victim state.</p>
